# sss_debuglevel

`sss_debuglevel` is a setting used in SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) to control the verbosity of debug logging. By adjusting the debug level, administrators can obtain detailed information about SSSD’s operations—useful for troubleshooting authentication issues, network connectivity, and configuration errors when integrating with remote identity sources such as LDAP or Active Directory.

## Purpose

- **Enhanced Troubleshooting**:  
  Higher debug levels produce more detailed logs, making it easier to diagnose problems with user lookups, authentication, and cache synchronization.
  
- **Configuration Validation**:  
  Debug logging helps verify that SSSD is correctly reading and applying its configuration settings from `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`.

## Configuration

### In `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`

The debug level is typically set using the `debug_level` parameter. This can be configured in the `[sssd]` section for general logging or within specific domain sections for targeted debugging.

#### Example (Global Configuration):

```ini
[sssd]
services = nss, pam
config_file_version = 2
debug_level = 9
```

#### Example (Domain-Specific Configuration):

```ini
[domain/example.com]
id_provider = ldap
auth_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://ldap.example.com
ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=com
debug_level = 9
```

- **Values**:  
  The value is an integer; the default is usually low (e.g., 0 or 1). For troubleshooting, values between 5 and 9 are common. Use higher values only temporarily, as they can generate very large log files.

## Runtime Adjustments

Some versions of SSSD may allow you to change the debug level at runtime using tools like `sssctl`. For example:

```bash
sssctl config-check
```

Check your specific SSSD documentation to see if dynamic adjustments are supported without restarting the service.

## Use Cases

- **Authentication Troubleshooting**:  
  When users face login issues or when SSSD fails to communicate with LDAP/AD, increasing the debug level can reveal detailed error messages and connection logs.
  
- **Performance Diagnostics**:  
  Detailed logs help identify slowdowns or bottlenecks in SSSD’s operation, which is useful in large or complex environments.
  
- **Verifying Configuration Changes**:  
  After modifying `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`, a higher debug level can confirm that new settings are being read and applied correctly.

## Best Practices

- **Temporary Debugging**:  
  Increase the debug level only while troubleshooting and revert to a lower level (or the default) once the issue is resolved to avoid performance impacts and excessive log growth.

- **Log Management**:  
  Ensure that log rotation is properly configured for SSSD log files (typically in `/var/log/sssd/`) to manage disk space effectively.

- **Monitor Logs**:  
  Use tools like `tail -f /var/log/sssd/sssd.log` to monitor logs in real-time during troubleshooting sessions.

## Conclusion

The `sss_debuglevel` parameter is a powerful tool within SSSD that helps administrators diagnose and resolve issues related to identity management and authentication. By adjusting the debug level in `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`, you can obtain detailed diagnostic logs that are essential for troubleshooting problems in environments that integrate with LDAP or Active Directory. Remember to use higher debug levels only as needed and revert to lower levels once issues are resolved.
