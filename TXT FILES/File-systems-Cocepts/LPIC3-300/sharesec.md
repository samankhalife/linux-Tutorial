# sharesec

In Samba, **sharesec** refers to the mechanism (typically implemented as a TDB file, often named `sharesec.tdb`) that stores share-level security information. This data defines the access control lists (ACLs) for Samba shares—separate from the underlying filesystem permissions—mimicking the behavior of Windows share permissions.

## Overview

- **Purpose**:  
  `sharesec` holds the security descriptors for Samba shares. It determines which users or groups have access to a particular share and what level of access (read, write, full control) they have.

- **Storage Mechanism**:  
  The share security information is stored in a Trivial Database (TDB) file, typically named `sharesec.tdb`, which is maintained by Samba. This file is automatically managed by Samba and is used to enforce share-level permissions when clients connect.

- **Integration with Windows**:  
  By implementing share-level ACLs similar to Windows, Samba can provide a more familiar security model for Windows clients, ensuring consistent behavior across a mixed-OS environment.

## Key Functions

- **Access Control**:  
  Controls which users and groups can access a share and with what permissions. These settings complement filesystem-level permissions.

- **Windows-Like Security Model**:  
  Allows Samba to emulate Windows share permissions, facilitating integration in networks where Windows and Unix systems coexist.

- **Administrative Management**:  
  Administrators can indirectly manage share security through Samba configuration (using tools like `smb.conf` and various Samba utilities) rather than editing the `sharesec.tdb` file directly.

## Usage and Management

- **Automatic Handling**:  
  Samba automatically updates `sharesec.tdb` when changes are made to share permissions via configuration or administrative tools (e.g., using `net rpc share` commands).

- **Administrative Tools**:  
  While direct editing of `sharesec.tdb` is uncommon, you can query or modify share security settings using Samba commands. For example:
  ```bash
  net rpc share info <sharename> -U <admin_user>
  ```
  This command displays detailed share information, including security settings stored in `sharesec.tdb`.

## Best Practices

- **Backup**:  
  Regularly include `sharesec.tdb` in your Samba backups to ensure that share security settings can be restored in case of corruption or accidental loss.

- **Security**:  
  Set strict file permissions on `sharesec.tdb` so that only the Samba process and trusted administrators can access it.

- **Monitoring**:  
  Keep an eye on changes to share permissions and audit logs to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Conclusion

The **sharesec** mechanism, typically implemented as `sharesec.tdb` in Samba, is crucial for managing share-level ACLs. By emulating Windows share permissions, it enables consistent and secure access control across mixed operating system environments. Proper backup, security, and monitoring of `sharesec.tdb` are essential to maintain the integrity of your Samba share security settings.
