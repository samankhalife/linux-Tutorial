# IPA
The The `ipa` command in **FreeIPA** (Identity, Policy, Audit) is a robust tool for managing users, hosts, services, and policies in a centralized manner. It provides subcommands that are essential for managing **hosts**, **hostgroups**, **services**, and **keytab files**—important components in managing a secure, identity-based infrastructure.

Below are detailed descriptions of these subcommands, including commands for **hosts**, **hostgroups**, **services**, and **keytabs**:

---

## Key Subcommands: `host`, `hostgroup`, `service`, and `getkeytab`

### 1. **Host Subcommands**
These commands allow the management of hosts (servers or systems) within the FreeIPA domain. Hosts are enrolled to gain authentication and policy-based access control.

#### Common Commands:
- **Add a Host**:
   ```bash
   ipa host-add <hostname> [options]
   ```
   Adds a new host to the domain (e.g., `ipa host-add server1.example.com`).

- **Find Hosts**:
   ```bash
   ipa host-find
   ```
   Lists all enrolled hosts in the domain.

- **Show Host Details**:
   ```bash
   ipa host-show <hostname>
   ```
   Displays detailed information about a specific host.

- **Modify a Host**:
   ```bash
   ipa host-mod <hostname> [options]
   ```
   Modifies attributes of an existing host, such as its description or principal.

- **Delete a Host**:
   ```bash
   ipa host-del <hostname>
   ```
   Removes a host from the domain.

- **Disable/Enable a Host**:
   - Disable: Temporarily removes the host from active use.
     ```bash
     ipa host-disable <hostname>
     ```
   - Enable: Restores the host to active use.
     ```bash
     ipa host-enable <hostname>
     ```

---

### 2. **Hostgroup Subcommands**
Hostgroups provide an easy way to manage multiple hosts together by grouping them logically, often for policy or access control purposes.

#### Common Commands:
- **Add a Hostgroup**:
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-add <hostgroup_name> --desc="Description"
   ```
   Creates a new hostgroup with a given description.

- **Find Hostgroups**:
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-find
   ```
   Lists all existing hostgroups.

- **Show Hostgroup Details**:
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-show <hostgroup_name>
   ```
   Displays detailed information about a specific hostgroup.

- **Add Hosts to a Hostgroup**:
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-add-member <hostgroup_name> --hosts=<hostname>
   ```
   Adds one or more hosts to a hostgroup.

- **Remove Hosts from a Hostgroup**:
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-remove-member <hostgroup_name> --hosts=<hostname>
   ```
   Removes one or more hosts from a hostgroup.

- **Delete a Hostgroup**:
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-del <hostgroup_name>
   ```
   Deletes a hostgroup from the domain.

---

### 3. **Service Subcommands**
Services represent applications (such as web services, mail services, etc.) running on hosts that require secure authentication through IPA. These commands manage such services.

#### Common Commands:
- **Add a Service**:
   ```bash
   ipa service-add <service/hostname>
   ```
   Adds a new service to the domain, enabling it to interact with the IPA environment (e.g., `HTTP/webserver01.example.com`).

- **Find Services**:
   ```bash
   ipa service-find
   ```
   Lists all services available in the domain.

- **Show Service Details**:
   ```bash
   ipa service-show <service/hostname>
   ```
   Displays detailed information about a specific service.

- **Delete a Service**:
   ```bash
   ipa service-del <service/hostname>
   ```
   Removes a service from the domain.

- **Enable/Disable a Service**:
   - Enable:
     ```bash
     ipa service-enable <service/hostname>
     ```
   - Disable:
     ```bash
     ipa service-disable <service/hostname>
     ```

---

### 4. **Getkeytab Subcommands**
Keytabs are files that store service or host credentials used for secure authentication, specifically with Kerberos. The `ipa-getkeytab` command fetches and manages keytab files.

#### Common Commands:
- **Obtain a Keytab for a Host**:
   ```bash
   ipa-getkeytab -s <IPA_server> -p host/<hostname> -k /etc/krb5.keytab
   ```
   Fetches the keytab for a specified host and stores it in the default Kerberos keytab location.

- **Obtain a Keytab for a Service**:
   ```bash
   ipa-getkeytab -s <IPA_server> -p <service/hostname> -k /etc/krb5.keytab
   ```
   Retrieves the keytab for a service running on a host.

- **Force a New Keytab**:
   ```bash
   ipa-getkeytab -s <IPA_server> -p <service/hostname> -k /etc/krb5.keytab -f
   ```
   Forces the retrieval of a new keytab, overwriting any existing keytab.

- **Remove a Keytab**:
   ```bash
   ipa service-remove-keytab <service/hostname> --keytab=<keytab_location>
   ```
   Deletes a keytab for a specific service, revoking its credentials.

## Example Scenario: Adding and Securing a Host with a Service

1. **Add the Host**:
   ```bash
   ipa host-add server1.example.com --force
   ```

2. **Create a Hostgroup** (e.g., all web servers):
   ```bash
   ipa hostgroup-add WebServers --desc="All web servers"
   ipa hostgroup-add-member WebServers --hosts=server1.example.com
   ```

3. **Add and Configure a Service**:
   For example, you may want to add an HTTP service for `server1`:
   ```bash
   ipa service-add HTTP/server1.example.com
   ```

4. **Obtain the Keytab for the HTTP Service**:
   ```bash
   ipa-getkeytab -s ipa.example.com -p HTTP/server1.example.com -k /etc/krb5.keytab
   ```

This ensures that the host and the service are authenticated and secure within the FreeIPA domain, with keytab-based Kerberos authentication.
