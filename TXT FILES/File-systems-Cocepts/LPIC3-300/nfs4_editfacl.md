# nfs4_editfacl

`nfs4_editfacl` is a command-line utility that allows system administrators to interactively edit Access Control Lists (ACLs) for files and directories on NFSv4-mounted filesystems. It combines the functionalities of `nfs4_setfacl` and `nfs4_getfacl`, allowing for on-the-fly editing of ACL entries in a text editor. This command provides a flexible and intuitive method for managing complex ACLs without needing to remember specific command-line options.

## Purpose

- **Interactive ACL Management**:  
  Allows administrators to edit NFSv4 ACLs interactively using a text editor, simplifying the process of viewing, modifying, and applying complex ACL rules.
  
- **Granular Access Control**:  
  Like `nfs4_setfacl`, this tool provides granular control over file and directory permissions beyond traditional UNIX permissions, using ACLs.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
nfs4_editfacl [OPTIONS] <FILE>
```

- **`<FILE>`**: The file or directory whose ACL you wish to edit.

## Common Options

- **`-e`**:  
  Edit the ACL entries for a given file or directory.
  ```bash
  nfs4_editfacl -e file.txt
  ```
  This opens the current ACLs of `file.txt` in a text editor for modification.

- **`-d`**:  
  Edit the default ACL for a directory.
  ```bash
  nfs4_editfacl -d /shared_directory
  ```
  This opens the default ACL for `/shared_directory` in a text editor, allowing changes that will apply to newly created files and directories within the directory.

- **`-R`**:  
  Recursively edit ACLs for all files and directories under a given path.
  ```bash
  nfs4_editfacl -R /project_directory
  ```

- **`--help`**:  
  Display help information for the command.
  ```bash
  nfs4_editfacl --help
  ```

## Example Usage

1. **Editing ACL for a File**
   ```bash
   nfs4_editfacl -e file.txt
   ```
   This command opens the current ACL settings for `file.txt` in the system's default text editor. The administrator can then modify the ACL entries and save the changes.

2. **Editing Default ACL for a Directory**
   ```bash
   nfs4_editfacl -d /shared
   ```
   Opens the default ACL for the `/shared` directory, allowing changes to the permissions that will be inherited by new files and directories created within `/shared`.

3. **Recursively Editing ACLs for a Directory and Its Subdirectories**
   ```bash
   nfs4_editfacl -R /data
   ```
   This command opens the ACLs for all files and directories under `/data`, allowing for bulk modification of ACLs.

## Benefits

- **User-Friendly**:  
  The interactive approach provided by `nfs4_editfacl` makes it easier to work with ACLs, especially for complex permissions, as it eliminates the need to remember all the command-line options for `nfs4_setfacl`.

- **Precision in ACL Management**:  
  By opening ACLs in a text editor, administrators can review the entire ACL structure before making changes, reducing the chance of misconfiguration.

## Best Practices

- **Backup Current ACLs**:  
  Before making changes with `nfs4_editfacl`, it's recommended to use `nfs4_getfacl` to backup the current ACLs in case you need to revert.

- **Verify Changes**:  
  After editing ACLs, use `nfs4_getfacl` or test access with relevant users to ensure that the new ACLs are working as intended.

## Conclusion

`nfs4_editfacl` simplifies the management of NFSv4 ACLs by providing an interactive, text-based interface. It is a powerful tool for system administrators who require flexibility and precision in controlling file and directory access in NFSv4-mounted filesystems.
