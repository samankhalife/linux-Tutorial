# kdestroy

`kdestroy` is a command-line utility used in Kerberos-based authentication systems to destroy (i.e., remove) the user's current credential cache. This effectively deletes the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and any service tickets, ensuring that no Kerberos credentials remain on the system.

## Purpose

- **Security**:  
  Removing Kerberos tickets after a session or before logging out reduces the risk of unauthorized reuse of authentication credentials.
  
- **Session Management**:  
  It is commonly used as part of logout procedures or security scripts to ensure that stale or potentially compromised credentials are purged.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
kdestroy [OPTIONS]
```

## Common Options

- **`-c <cache>`**:  
  Specifies a particular credential cache file to destroy.  
  _Example_:  
  ```bash
  kdestroy -c /tmp/krb5cc_1000
  ```
  This command deletes the credentials stored in the specified cache.

- **`-A`**:  
  Removes all credential caches for the current user.  
  _Example_:  
  ```bash
  kdestroy -A
  ```
  This command clears all Kerberos tickets from all caches associated with the current user.

## Example Usage

1. **Destroy the Default Credential Cache**:  
   Simply run:
   ```bash
   kdestroy
   ```
   This command removes the default Kerberos ticket cache (typically referenced by the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable).

2. **Destroy a Specific Credential Cache**:  
   To target a specific cache file:
   ```bash
   kdestroy -c /tmp/krb5cc_1000
   ```

3. **Remove All Credential Caches**:  
   To clear every Kerberos credential cache for the current user:
   ```bash
   kdestroy -A
   ```

## Use Cases

- **Logout Procedures**:  
  Incorporated into user logout scripts to ensure that no Kerberos tickets persist after the user logs off.

- **Security Compliance**:  
  Regularly clearing credential caches minimizes the risk of credential theft or misuse, especially in shared or insecure environments.

- **Troubleshooting**:  
  If Kerberos authentication issues arise, clearing the ticket cache with `kdestroy` followed by re-obtaining a ticket using `kinit` can often resolve the problem.

## Considerations

- **Re-authentication**:  
  After running `kdestroy`, the user must re-authenticate (typically using `kinit`) to obtain new Kerberos tickets for any further authenticated operations.

- **Multiple Caches**:  
  In systems with multiple credential caches, using the `-A` option ensures all caches are cleared, but be cautious as this might affect concurrent processes using Kerberos.

## Conclusion

`kdestroy` is an essential tool in Kerberos environments, ensuring that authentication tickets are securely removed from the system when no longer needed. Its use is critical for maintaining system security by preventing unauthorized reuse of credentials and supporting proper session management. Whether used manually or incorporated into automated scripts, `kdestroy` plays a key role in the effective management of Kerberos authentication.
