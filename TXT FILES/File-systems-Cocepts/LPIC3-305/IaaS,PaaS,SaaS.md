# IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

These are the three primary models of cloud computing service delivery. Each offers a different level of abstraction, control, and responsibility for infrastructure and applications.

## IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

**Definition**: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers the most control to users over infrastructure but requires management of the operating system, middleware, and applications.

### Characteristics
- Provides VMs, networking, storage, and firewalls
- Users manage OS, runtime, and applications
- Flexible and scalable
- Pay-as-you-go pricing

### Examples
- AWS EC2
- Google Compute Engine
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- OpenStack

### Use Cases
- Hosting custom web apps
- Migrating on-premises workloads
- Building testing/staging environments

---

## PaaS – Platform as a Service

**Definition**: PaaS offers a ready-to-use development and deployment environment. It abstracts infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

### Characteristics
- Manages runtime, OS, servers, and storage
- Developers focus on code and configuration
- Supports CI/CD, scaling, and monitoring
- Reduces operational overhead

### Examples
- Google App Engine
- Heroku
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Azure App Services

### Use Cases
- Rapid application development
- Deploying web apps without managing servers
- Supporting microservices architecture

---

## SaaS – Software as a Service

**Definition**: SaaS delivers fully functional applications over the internet, accessed via a web browser. Users don't manage any infrastructure or platform components.

### Characteristics
- Ready-to-use software applications
- Managed entirely by the vendor
- Subscription-based or freemium pricing
- Accessible from anywhere

### Examples
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs)
- Microsoft 365
- Salesforce
- Dropbox

### Use Cases
- Email and collaboration tools
- CRM and ERP systems
- File storage and sharing platforms

|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| User Control     | Full (OS, runtime, apps)    | App-level (code, config)      | Minimal (just app use)       |
| Management Level | High                        | Moderate                      | Low                          |
| Flexibility      | Maximum                     | Medium                        | Low                          |
| Target Users     | Sysadmins, DevOps, SREs     | Developers, App engineers     | End users, Business teams    |
| Responsibility   | You manage most resources   | Provider manages platform     | Provider manages everything  |

## Conclusion

- **IaaS** is ideal for teams needing full control and flexibility to configure infrastructure.
- **PaaS** is suitable for developers focused on building and deploying applications quickly.
- **SaaS** fits end-users who need ready-to-use applications with minimal management.
