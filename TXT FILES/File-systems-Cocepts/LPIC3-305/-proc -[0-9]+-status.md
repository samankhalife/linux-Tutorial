The `/proc/[PID]/status` file in Linux provides detailed information about a process, where `[PID]` is the process ID of a running process. It contains various fields that describe the status of the process, such as memory usage, state, and other statistics.

Here's a breakdown of the contents and some of the common fields you will find in the `/proc/[PID]/status` file:

### Common Fields in `/proc/[PID]/status`

1. **Name**
   - The name of the process.
   - Example: `Name:  bash`

2. **Pid**
   - The Process ID (PID) of the process.
   - Example: `Pid: 1234`

3. **PPid**
   - The Parent Process ID (PPID), which is the PID of the process that started this process.
   - Example: `PPid: 5678`

4. **Uid**
   - User ID (UID) of the process owner.
   - Example: `Uid: 1000 1000 1000 1000`

5. **Gid**
   - Group ID (GID) of the process.
   - Example: `Gid: 1000 1000 1000 1000`

6. **VmSize**
   - The total virtual memory size of the process in kilobytes.
   - Example: `VmSize:   10240 kB`

7. **VmRSS**
   - The resident set size (RSS), which is the non-swapped physical memory the process uses, in kilobytes.
   - Example: `VmRSS:   2048 kB`

8. **State**
   - The state of the process. This can be one of the following:
     - `R`: Running
     - `S`: Sleeping
     - `D`: Waiting for I/O
     - `Z`: Zombie
     - `T`: Stopped
     - `W`: Paging
   - Example: `State: S (sleeping)`

9. **Tgid**
   - Thread Group ID. For multithreaded processes, this is the PID of the first thread.
   - Example: `Tgid: 1234`

10. **Threads**
    - The number of threads currently being used by the process.
    - Example: `Threads: 2`

11. **TracerPid**
    - The PID of the process tracing this one (if any).
    - Example: `TracerPid: 0`

12. **FDSize**
    - The number of file descriptors the process has opened.
    - Example: `FDSize: 64`

13. **SigQ**
    - The number of pending signals for the process.
    - Example: `SigQ: 0/123`

14. **CapInh**
    - Inherited capabilities for the process.
    - Example: `CapInh: 00000000`

15. **CapPrm**
    - Effective capabilities for the process.
    - Example: `CapPrm: 00000000`

16. **CapEff**
    - The processâ€™s current capabilities.
    - Example: `CapEff: 00000000`

17. **Seccomp**
    - The process's seccomp filter mode.
    - Example: `Seccomp: 0`

18. **Cpus_allowed**
    - A bitmask of CPUs on which the process can run.
    - Example: `Cpus_allowed: 00000001`

19. **Cpus_allowed_list**
    - A more readable format of CPUs allowed.
    - Example: `Cpus_allowed_list: 0`

20. **Mems_allowed**
    - A bitmask of memory nodes that the process can use.
    - Example: `Mems_allowed: 00000001`

### Example of `/proc/[PID]/status`

```bash
Name:   bash
Pid:    1234
PPid:   5678
Uid:    1000    1000    1000    1000
Gid:    1000    1000    1000    1000
State:  S (sleeping)
VmSize: 10240 kB
VmRSS:  2048 kB
Threads:        2
FDSize: 64
SigQ:   0/123
CapInh: 00000000
CapPrm: 00000000
CapEff: 00000000
Seccomp:        0
Cpus_allowed:   00000001
Cpus_allowed_list:       0
Mems_allowed:   00000001
```

### Usage

You can use a regular expression like `-proc -[0-9]+-status` to find and parse the `status` files for processes, where:

- `/proc/[PID]/status` contains the status information of the process with ID `PID`.
- The `[0-9]+` part of the regular expression will match any process ID, so it can be used to find all status files in the `/proc` directory.

For example, to view the `status` of a process with PID 1234:
```bash
cat /proc/1234/status
```

This gives a comprehensive snapshot of the process, useful for monitoring system performance, debugging, or gaining insight into process behavior.
