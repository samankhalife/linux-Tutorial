# Hypervisor

A **hypervisor**, also known as a **virtual machine monitor (VMM)**, is a software layer that enables virtualization by allowing multiple operating systems (OS) to run concurrently on a host machine. It abstracts the underlying hardware, allocating resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to each guest OS, thereby creating isolated virtual environments known as virtual machines (VMs).

## Types of Hypervisors

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal)**:
   - **Description**: Runs directly on the host's hardware without an underlying operating system.
   - **Examples**: Xen, VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Enhanced performance due to direct hardware access.
     - Improved security and stability, as there is no underlying OS that could be compromised.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires dedicated hardware resources.
     - Potential compatibility issues with certain hardware or software.

2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)**:
   - **Description**: Operates on top of a host operating system, utilizing the host's resources to manage guest OSes.
   - **Examples**: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Easier to set up and use, suitable for development and testing environments.
     - Leverages existing host OS features and drivers.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Overhead from the host OS can impact performance.
     - Potential security risks due to reliance on the host OS's security measures.

## Hypervisor in the Context of LPIC-3 Exam 305-300

The **LPIC-3 Virtualization and Containerization Exam (305-300)** assesses advanced knowledge of virtualization and containerization technologies. Understanding hypervisors is crucial for this certification, as they are foundational to virtualization concepts. The exam objectives include:

- **Topic 351: Full Virtualization**
  - **351.1 Virtualization Concepts and Theory**: Covers the fundamentals of virtualization, including the types of hypervisors and their benefits and drawbacks. citeturn0search1
  - **351.2 Xen**: Focuses on the installation, configuration, and management of Xen hypervisor environments.
  - **351.3 QEMU**: Involves using QEMU for virtualization, including command-line operations and snapshot management.
  - **351.4 Libvirt Virtual Machine Management**: Entails managing virtual machines using libvirt and related tools.
  - **351.5 Virtual Machine Disk Image Management**: Involves managing VM disk images, including conversions and accessing data within images. citeturn0search10

A solid grasp of hypervisor technologies, particularly Xen and QEMU, and their management through tools like libvirt, is essential for success in the LPIC-3 305-300 exam.
