# Split-Brain

**Split-brain** occurs in a clustered or distributed system when two or more nodes lose communication with each other and mistakenly assume they are the primary node. This can lead to situations where each partition continues to operate independently, potentially making conflicting decisions and causing data inconsistencies or corruption.

## Key Points

- **Definition:**  
  Split-brain happens when cluster nodes, which should work in coordination to maintain a single consistent state, become isolated (due to network failures, misconfiguration, etc.) and each segment believes it is the only active portion of the cluster.

- **Causes:**  
  - **Network Partitioning:** Disruptions in network connectivity can isolate nodes.
  - **Configuration Errors:** Misconfigured quorum or heartbeat settings can lead to false assumptions about node health.
  - **Hardware Failures:** Physical failures in network components may cause some nodes to lose contact with others.

- **Consequences:**  
  - **Data Inconsistency:** Multiple nodes may process updates to the same data simultaneously, leading to divergent data sets.
  - **Resource Conflicts:** Both partitions may attempt to access shared resources, potentially causing conflicts or corruption.
  - **Operational Confusion:** Each partition may perform actions (e.g., starting services, triggering failover) that conflict with the actions taken by the other partition.

- **Prevention and Resolution:**  
  - **Quorum Mechanisms:** Implement quorum-based decision-making to ensure that only the partition with a majority of nodes remains active.
  - **Fencing (STONITH):** Use fencing techniques to isolate nodes that lose communication to prevent them from acting independently.
  - **Heartbeat Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of node health and connectivity helps detect and respond to split-brain conditions quickly.
  - **Cluster Software:** Modern cluster management systems (such as Pacemaker with Corosync) include built-in mechanisms to detect and resolve split-brain scenarios automatically.

## Example Scenario

Consider a two-node cluster where both nodes share access to a common storage system. If the network link between the two nodes fails, each node might assume it is the sole active node and continue processing I/O operations. Without proper quorum or fencing mechanisms, both nodes could update the shared storage concurrently, leading to data corruption. A well-configured cluster would detect the loss of communication, trigger fencing to isolate one node, or use quorum rules to decide which node remains active, thereby preventing split-brain.

## Conclusion

Split-brain is a critical challenge in high-availability and distributed systems, as it can lead to severe data integrity issues and operational disruptions. Effective strategies to prevent and mitigate split-brain include implementing robust quorum mechanisms, employing fencing techniques, and ensuring reliable network connectivity. These measures help maintain a single consistent view of the cluster, thereby preserving data integrity and ensuring reliable operation.
