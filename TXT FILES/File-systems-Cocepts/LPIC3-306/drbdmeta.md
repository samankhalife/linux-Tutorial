# drbdmeta
`drbdmeta` is a low-level command-line utility in the DRBD suite that allows administrators to inspect, dump, and manipulate the metadata stored on DRBD devices. DRBD uses this metadata to maintain information about replication status, synchronization progress, and configuration details for each replicated block device.



## Purpose

- **Metadata Inspection:**  
  Allows you to view the metadata information of a DRBD device, which can be useful for troubleshooting replication issues or verifying configuration details.

- **Data Recovery and Repair:**  
  In scenarios where DRBD metadata is suspected to be corrupted or out of sync, `drbdmeta` can help diagnose and, in some cases, repair the metadata. Because metadata is critical to DRBD operations, any manipulation should be performed with caution.

- **Low-Level Diagnostics:**  
  Useful for advanced users who need to perform manual checks or modifications of the metadata for recovery purposes or when preparing a DRBD device for reconfiguration.



## Typical Use Cases

- **Metadata Dump:**  
  Extract and view the metadata from a DRBD device for diagnostic purposes.
  
- **Consistency Verification:**  
  Compare metadata on different nodes to ensure that replication and synchronization are occurring correctly.
  
- **Advanced Troubleshooting:**  
  When facing complex replication issues, `drbdmeta` can be used to inspect internal metadata structures that are not visible through standard DRBD status commands.



## Important Considerations

- **Risk of Data Loss:**  
  Manipulating DRBD metadata is inherently risky. Incorrect use of `drbdmeta` can result in data loss or render a DRBD device unusable. Always ensure you have complete backups and a recovery plan before performing any metadata modifications.

- **Intended for Advanced Users:**  
  This tool is generally reserved for system administrators with a deep understanding of DRBD internals and for use in troubleshooting scenarios rather than routine operations.

- **Documentation and Support:**  
  Detailed usage information is typically found in the DRBD user guide or specific DRBD documentation. Because it operates at a low level, consult the official DRBD documentation and community resources if you plan to use it.



## Example Usage

While the exact command options may vary depending on the DRBD version and specific requirements, a hypothetical usage to dump metadata might look like:

```bash
drbdmeta /dev/drbd0 dump
```

This command would extract and display the metadata from the DRBD device `/dev/drbd0`. Always check the available options (e.g., using `drbdmeta --help`) to understand the specific parameters and operations available for your DRBD version.



## Conclusion

`drbdmeta` is a specialized tool designed for deep inspection and manipulation of DRBD metadata. It serves an important role in advanced troubleshooting and repair of DRBD devices, but due to the inherent risks associated with low-level metadata operations, it should be used cautiously and only by experienced administrators.
