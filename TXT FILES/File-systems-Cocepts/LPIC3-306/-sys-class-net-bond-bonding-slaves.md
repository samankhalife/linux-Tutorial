The `/sys/class/net/bond*/bonding/slaves` file is part of the Linux sysfs filesystem and is used to display the list of network interfaces (slaves) currently bonded to a particular bonding interface. The wildcard (`*`) in `bond*` refers to the name of the bonding interface (e.g., `bond0`, `bond1`).

## Example of Usage

1. **Check bonded slaves for `bond0`:**

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
```

This will return a list of network interfaces (e.g., `eth0`, `eth1`) that are currently enslaved (bonded) to `bond0`.

### Example Output:
```
eth0 eth1
```

This shows that `eth0` and `eth1` are slaves of `bond0`.

2. **Check bonded slaves for any bonding interface:**

If you're unsure of the bonding interface name, you can list the slaves for all bond interfaces by using a wildcard:

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/bond*/bonding/slaves
```

This command will return the bonded slaves for all available bonding interfaces in your system.

### Additional Bonding Information

You can also explore more details about each bonding interface by checking other files under `/sys/class/net/bond*/bonding/`. For example:

- **Mode of the bonding interface:**

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/mode
```

- **Status of each bonded interface (including link state):**

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/ad_actor_oper_port_state
```

- **Link status of each slave:**

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slave_eth0/link_failure_count
```

This structure under `/sys/class/net/` provides detailed bonding information, including the performance and status of each slave in a bonding interface.

### Summary

The `/sys/class/net/bond*/bonding/slaves` file gives a straightforward way to check which network interfaces are currently part of a bond. This is particularly useful in environments where network redundancy and load balancing are configured through network interface bonding.
