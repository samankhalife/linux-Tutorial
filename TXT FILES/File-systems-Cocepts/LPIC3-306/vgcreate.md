# vgcreate 
The `vgcreate` command in Linux is used to create a new volume group (VG) in the Logical Volume Manager (LVM). A volume group is a collection of physical volumes (PVs) that can be used to create logical volumes (LVs). You use this command to allocate space from the available physical volumes and create a volume group that can be further used to create logical volumes.

### Syntax
```bash
vgcreate [Options] VolumeGroupName PhysicalVolumePath [...]
```

- **`VolumeGroupName`**: The name of the volume group you want to create.
- **`PhysicalVolumePath`**: The path to one or more physical volumes (e.g., `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sdb1`, etc.) to include in the new volume group.

### Options
- **`-s, --size`**: Specifies the physical extent (PE) size for the volume group. If not specified, the default PE size is used.
- **`-n, --name`**: This option is not used directly with `vgcreate`, but could be relevant in more complex LVM configurations.
- **`-p, --physicalextents`**: Specifies the number of physical extents to create for the volume group.
- **`--addtag`**: Add tags to the volume group.
- **`--setphysicalvolumesize`**: Set the physical volume size when creating the volume group.

### Example Usage

#### 1. **Create a Volume Group from a Single Physical Volume**

If you have a physical volume `/dev/sda1` and want to create a volume group called `vgdata`, you would run:

```bash
sudo vgcreate vgdata /dev/sda1
```

This creates a new volume group `vgdata` using the `/dev/sda1` physical volume.

#### 2. **Create a Volume Group from Multiple Physical Volumes**

You can create a volume group from multiple physical volumes. For example, to create a volume group `vgdata` using both `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1`:

```bash
sudo vgcreate vgdata /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
```

This command creates the volume group `vgdata` using the two physical volumes `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1`.

#### 3. **Specify a Physical Extent Size**

If you want to specify the size of the physical extents, you can use the `-s` option. For example, to create a volume group `vgdata` with a physical extent size of 8 MB, using the physical volume `/dev/sda1`:

```bash
sudo vgcreate -s 8M vgdata /dev/sda1
```

This sets the physical extent size to 8 MB.

#### 4. **Create a Volume Group with Multiple Physical Volumes and Specify Extent Size**

You can combine multiple physical volumes and specify the extent size as follows:

```bash
sudo vgcreate -s 8M vgdata /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
```

This will create a volume group `vgdata` with physical extents of 8 MB, using `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1` as the physical volumes.

### Example Output
When you successfully run the `vgcreate` command, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
  Volume group "vgdata" successfully created
```

This indicates that the volume group `vgdata` was created successfully.

### Key Points

- **Volume Group**: A container for logical volumes. It is created from one or more physical volumes.
- **Physical Extents**: The basic units of allocation in LVM. The size of the physical extent can be customized during volume group creation.
- **Multiple Physical Volumes**: A volume group can span multiple physical devices (disks), and you can add more physical volumes to the volume group later.
- **Flexibility**: LVM provides flexibility by allowing you to expand or shrink your volume groups and logical volumes dynamically.

### Conclusion

The `vgcreate` command is essential when setting up LVM on Linux. It allows you to create volume groups from physical volumes, which are the building blocks for creating logical volumes. Logical volumes are used to manage storage more flexibly, enabling you to resize volumes or add new ones without needing to partition or format the underlying disks.
