# syncd

**syncd** (synchronization daemon) is a process commonly used in network operating systems like **SONiC** (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) to bridge the gap between high-level network configuration and the underlying hardware. It is part of the implementation of the **Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI)**, which provides a standardized API for controlling network switch ASICs.

## Purpose and Functionality

- **Hardware Synchronization:**  
  **syncd** monitors for configuration changes from the control plane and translates these high-level commands into hardware-specific instructions. This ensures that the state of the switch ASIC accurately reflects the desired configuration.

- **SAI Implementation:**  
  The daemon acts as an intermediary that implements SAI calls. It receives API calls from the network operating system and performs the necessary actions on the hardware, often using a vendor-specific SAI library (e.g., from Mellanox, Broadcom, or others).

- **Reliability and Consistency:**  
  By continuously synchronizing the desired configuration with the actual hardware state, **syncd** plays a critical role in maintaining network stability and high availability.

- **Logging and Troubleshooting:**  
  The daemon typically logs its operations, which can help in troubleshooting issues related to configuration changes or hardware state discrepancies.

## Typical Environment

- **SONiC and Other NOS:**  
  **syncd** is an integral part of SONiC and similar network operating systems where the decoupling of hardware control (via SAI) from the OS is necessary. It enables operators to use standardized management interfaces while relying on the vendor-specific capabilities of the hardware.

- **Vendor-Specific Implementations:**  
  While the functionality is standardized by SAI, the underlying implementation of **syncd** may vary between hardware vendors, which might lead to differences in performance or supported features.

## Example Workflow

1. **Configuration Change:**  
   An operator makes a change in the network configuration using SONiCâ€™s management tools.
2. **SAI API Call:**  
   The change is translated into one or more SAI API calls, which are then handed off to **syncd**.
3. **Hardware Update:**  
   **syncd** processes the API calls and applies the necessary changes to the switch ASIC, ensuring that the hardware configuration matches the intended network configuration.
4. **Logging and Feedback:**  
   The daemon logs the actions performed and provides feedback to the control plane, allowing for monitoring and troubleshooting if needed.

## Conclusion

**syncd** is a crucial component in modern network operating systems that utilize the SAI framework. It ensures that high-level configuration changes are accurately and reliably implemented in the switch hardware, contributing to overall network performance, stability, and manageability.
